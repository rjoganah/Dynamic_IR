695 CUOMO--Hon. Mario M. The St. John's University family celebrates the life and mourns the passing of the Honorable Mario Cuomo, '53C, '56 LAW, '75HON, 52nd Governor of the State of New York, illustrious and accomplished alumnus, and a respected member of this community for almost 70 years. His was the quintessential St. John's story: son of immigrants, he graduated from St. John's Prep as well as St. John's University and went on to forge a remarkable career of public service that was inspired by the values and vision of St. Vincent de Paul, the founder of the religious community that sponsors St. John's. Like St. Vincent, Mario Cuomo was an eloquent advocate for the poor and a compassionate, caring leader. Despite the demands of a busy career, he returned often to alma mater, sharing his wisdom and experience. Our University is stronger and better because he has been a part of it. St. John's extends its prayers and deepest sympathy to his wife of sixty years, Matilda, whom he met at St. John's, and to his children and grandchildren. Peter P.

When called to a career in the political arena, he rose to that singular challenge to become the longest- serving Democratic governor in the State's modern history.

It is with great sadness that the partners, counsel, associates, and staff of Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher LLP mourn the passing of our distinguished friend, partner and counsel, Mario M. Cuomo. Governor Cuomo exemplified our firm's 125- year tradition of practicing law at the highest level. His 20 years of service to clients epitomizes the true pinnacle of our profession: sage advisor and formidable adversary. Governor Cuomo gave generously of his time to colleagues and staff at Willkie and we admired him greatly. At our firm, he continued his legendary oratory, with talks that were thought-provoking, intellectually elegant, and always entertaining. He frequently devoted time to speak with those whose path he crossed daily in our offices, and particularly enjoyed speaking with young lawyers starting out in their careers, sharing his insights about the rule of law and its place in society, the contribution and influence of immigrants, and state and national politics. Following an illustrious career in public service, Governor Cuomo joined our firm as a partner on February 15, 1995 having served as Governor of New York State for three terms, and he remained a valued member of the Willkie family until his death. He was elected New York State's 52nd Governor in 1982 and won re-election in both 1986 and 1990. He was the longest serving Democratic governor in the modern history of New York State. At Willkie, he specialized in litigation, corporate transactions, special corporate investigations, and mediations. Governor Cuomo was admitted to the Bar of the State of New York, the United States District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the United States Supreme Court. He received a J.D. (summa cum laude) from St. John's University School of Law in 1956, where he tied for top-of-the- class honors, and a B.A. (summa cum laude) from St. Johns University in 1953. He served 13 years as an adjunct professor at St. John's University School of Law and clerked for New York State's highest court, the Court of Appeals, under Judge Adrian P. Burke. Governor Cuomo was the recent recipient<br></br><br> of a "Lifetime Achievement Award" from the New York Law Journal in recognition of his career accomplishments and the profound impact he has made on the law, in New York's legal community, and as New York State's Governor. We send our deepest sympathies to Mario's wife, Matilda, to his children, Governor Andrew Cuomo, Maria Cuomo Cole, Margaret Cuomo, Madeline Cuomo, Chris Cuomo, and to all of his extended family.</br><br></br><br>

720 CUOMO--Hon. Mario M. A loving and beloved husband, father and grandfather. A first generation Italian-American who epitomized the lure and the bounty of the American dream. A courageous, compassionate, insightful, visionary, inspiring, pragmatic and innovative political leader who made government work better and made it work to better the lives of New York State's 16 million citizens. From his earliest days as a top flight attorney in private practice, he fought to bring disparate peoples and their communities together for their and New York City's common good. Serving as New York's Secretary of State, Lieutenant Governor, and thereafter as three-time Governor of New York State, Mr. Cuomo by his integrity, hard work and principles, raised the bar for all those who followed him into elected office and public service, and by his eloquent words summoned the best in all of us as New Yorkers and Americans -male or female, white, black, brown or yellow, rich or poor, powerful or not, immigrant or native born -to join together, arm in arm, to be part of the family of New York and the bigger family of America, so that each of us does well when we all do well, and that we all ache when one of us is in pain. Let us honor this great and noble man's wishes by embracing one another now, when his family and all New Yorkers need it most.

Serving as New York's Secretary of State, Lieutenant Governor, and thereafter as three-time Governor of New York State, Mr. Cuomo by his integrity, hard work and principles, raised the bar for all those who followed him into elected office and public service, and by his eloquent words summoned the best in all of us as New Yorkers and Americans -male or female, white, black, brown or yellow, rich or poor, powerful or not, immigrant or native born -to join together, arm in arm, to be part of the family of New York and the bigger family of America, so that each of us does well when we all do well, and that we all ache when one of us is in pain. Let us honor this great and noble man's wishes by embracing one another now, when his family and all New Yorkers need it most. We extend our deepest sympathies and condolences to Mrs. Matilda Cuomo, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Dr. Margaret Cuomo, Maria Cuomo Cole, Madeline Cuomo O'Donoghue and Christopher Cuomo and their spouses and significant others and to the 14 Cuomo grandchildren.

769 CUOMO--Mario M. It is with great sadness that the partners, counsel, associates, and staff of Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher LLP mourn the passing of our distinguished friend, partner and counsel, Mario M. Cuomo. Governor Cuomo exemplified our firm's 125- year tradition of practicing law at the highest level. His 20 years of service to clients epitomizes the true pinnacle of our profession: sage advisor and formidable adversary. Governor Cuomo gave generously of his time to colleagues and staff at Willkie and we admired him greatly. At our firm, he continued his legendary oratory, with talks that were thought-provoking, intellectually elegant, and always entertaining. He frequently devoted time to speak with those whose path he crossed daily in our offices, and particularly enjoyed speaking with young lawyers starting out in their careers, sharing his insights about the rule of law and its place in society, the contribution and influence of immigrants, and state and national politics. Following an illustrious career in public service, Governor Cuomo joined our firm as a partner on February 15, 1995 having served as Governor of New York State for three terms, and he remained a valued member of the Willkie family until his death. He was elected New York State's 52nd Governor in 1982 and won re-election in both 1986 and 1990. He was the longest serving Democratic governor in the modern history of New York State. At Willkie, he specialized in litigation, corporate transactions, special corporate investigations, and mediations. Governor Cuomo was admitted to the Bar of the State of New York, the United States District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the United States Supreme Court. He received a J.D. (summa cum laude) from St. John's University School of Law in 1956, where he tied for top-of-the- class honors, and a B.A. (summa cum laude) from St. Johns University in 1953. He served 13 years as an adjunct professor at St. John's University School of Law and clerked for New York State's highest court, the Court of Appeals, under Judge Adrian P. Burke. Governor Cuomo was the recent recipient of a "Lifetime Achievement Award" from the New York Law Journal in recognition of his career accomplishments and the profound impact he has made on the law, in New York's legal community, and as New York State's Governor. We send our deepest sympathies to Mario's wife, Matilda, to his children, Governor Andrew Cuomo, Maria Cuomo Cole, Margaret Cuomo, Madeline Cuomo, Chris Cuomo, and to all of his extended family. 1/3
